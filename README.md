Hi, I'm a 21 year old programming and chess enthusiast from Jamaica. Iâ€™m also pursuing a degree in Computer Science at **The University of the West Indies, Mona Campus**. I'm also a contributor to the [Talawa Open Source Projects](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation). Currently, I'm building [LiTrainer](https://litrainer.vercel.app/), a tool to enhance the *learn from your mistakes* feature on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/)

### I'm currently working on [Cage Match Arena](https://cage-match-uilx.vercel.app/) and [LiTrainer](https://litrainer.vercel.app/)
